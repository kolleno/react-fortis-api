# Device Binding Status Enum

Enables the communication of Device Binding Status between the ACS, the DS and the 3DS Requestor. For bound devices (value = 11â€“14), Device Binding Status also conveys the type of binding that was performed.

> 01 - Device is not bound by Cardholder
> 
> 02 - Not eligible as determined by Issuer
> 
> 03 - Pending confirmation by Cardholder
> 
> 04 - Cardholder rejected
> 
> 05 - Device Binding Status unknown, unavailable, or does not apply
> 
> 06 through 10 - Reserved for EMVCo future use (values invalid until defined by EMVCo)
> 
> 11 - Device is bound by Cardholder (device is bound using hardware / SIM internal to the Consumer Device. For instance, keys stored in a secure element on the device)
> 
> 12 - Device is bound by Cardholder (device is bound using hardware external to the Consumer Device. For example, an external FIDO Authenticator
> 
> 13 - Device is bound by Cardholder (device is bound using data that includes dynamically generated data and could include a unique device ID)
> 
> 14 - Device is bound by Cardholder (device is bound using static device data that has been obtained from the Consumer Device
> 
> 15 - Device is bound by Cardholder (Other method)
> 
> 16 through 79 - Reserved for EMVCo future use (values invalid until defined by EMVCo)
> 
> 80 through 99 - Reserved for DS use
